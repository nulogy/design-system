This is a guide for Nulogy employees who wish to contribute to the Design System.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Download and install the latest LTS version of [Node (12.16.3)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Download and install the package manager [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable)

### Cloning the repo

2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
3. Run `yarn build` to build the components for the first time

## Writing components

- `yarn start` will run a storybook at [localhost:8080](localhost:8080) for local development.
- `yarn build` will rebuild the package exports for production.

To generate the files needed for a new component, you can use [Plop](https://plopjs.com/)
