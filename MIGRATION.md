# Migration Guide

## Migrating from v4 to v5:

### 1. Install @nulogy/icons

@nulogy/icons is now a peerDependency so you will need to add it your projects dependencies:

`yarn add @nulogy/icons`
or
`npm i @nulogy/icons`

This was done to support using new icons without having to upgrade @nulogy/components.

### 2. AsyncSelect onChange handler

If you are using the AsyncSelect component in your project, please update the onChange handler if you are using it. `onChange` now returns the complete option object that is selected rather than just the string value.
    ```
    onChange = (value) => {}
    
    //becomes
    
    onChange = ({value, label}). => {}
    ````
If you needed to use the AsyncSelect as a controlled component, this was broken in previous verisons but now you can do so  by using the `onChange` and `value` prop.

### 3. MonthPicker and MonthRange components

MonthPicker and MonthRange components were removed from this version. If you need these components or are planning to use them soon, please reach out to DesignOps.

## Migrating from v3 to v4:

Breaking changes are limited to the TimePicker component which was redesigned. The behaviour of that component was redesigned and may break some e2e tests, but otherwise there are no code changes to make.

## Migrating from v2 to v3:

### 1. Install styled-components

Styled-components (v5) is now a peerDependency so you will need to add it your projects dependencies:

`yarn add styled-components`
`npm i styled-components`

### 2. Wrap your application in an NDS Provider

All components must be wrapped in an <NDSProvider> component. This was already an installation step in the [README](https://github.com/nulogy/design-system/blob/master/README.md), but it is now required and you will see undefined theme or color errors if this step is not already done.

### 3. Wrap component tests in the NDS Provider

All tests using NDS components must be wrapped in the NDSProvider as well. You can make a custom helper that can be reused throughout your app to wrap components in the Providers you need.

You can use the [render](https://github.com/nulogy/design-system/blob/master/components/src/NDSProvider/render.spec-utils.js) we use as a guide to write your own
