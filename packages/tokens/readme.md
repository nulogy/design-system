## What are tokens?

> Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system ‚Äî specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.

You probably shouldn't be pulling this into an application, unless you need access to raw sass, css, or javascript values for some reason.
