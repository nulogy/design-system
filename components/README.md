## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Add the package

## Peer dependencies

@nulogy/components relies on React, ReactDOM and Styled Components. You will need to add these to your projects dependencies if they are not there already.

To add Styled Components:
`yarn add styled-components@^5.0.0`

Please check that you are using versions that match the peerDependencies listed in the components/package.json.

## Usage

### 2. Add fonts

Add [IBM Plex Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans:300,400,500,600) and [IBM Plex Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans) to your application, however you prefer to load assets. An example using Google Fonts is shown below.

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=IBM+Plex+Sans:300,400,500,600" rel="stylesheet" />
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=IBM+Plex+Mono" rel="stylesheet" />
```

### 2. Wrap your appliction in our theme provider

Wrap your application in the NDSProvider component to access Nulogy's theme values and add typographic defaults.

```js
import React from "react";
import { NDSProvider } from "@nulogy/components";

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <NDSProvider>// your application</NDSProvider>;
  }
}
```

### 3. Import desired components

```js
import { Button } from "@nulogy/components";

const SomeView = () => <Button>Click me</Button>;
```
