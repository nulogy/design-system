# Nulogy Design System

The Nulogy Design System is a collection of Visual Guidelines and UI Components that will allow designers and developers to quickly create consistent experiences for our customers using established best practices.

## Components

The primary way to interface with the system is by using our React components. They can be found in a package called [@nulogy/components](https://github.com/nulogy/design-system/tree/master/components).

## CSS

If your application can't use React components we also provide atomic CSS classes and Sass variables to build your own interface in Nulogy's style. These can be found in a package called [@nulogy/css](https://github.com/nulogy/design-system/tree/master/css).

## Tokens

Design tokens are stored in their own package called [@nulogy/tokens](https://github.com/nulogy/design-system/tree/master/tokens). These are mostly used to build our Components and CSS packages above, but can also be imported directly into your application if needed.

## UI Kit

Designers can use the Nulogy Design System in Sketch by downloading the [Sketch UI Kit](https://share.goabstract.com/73221fd2-6626-43c8-b95c-e4bec74741ab)
