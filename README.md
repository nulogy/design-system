![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@nulogy/components.svg)

## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Add the package

## Peer dependencies

@nulogy/components relies on React, ReactDOM and Styled Components. You will need to add these to your projects dependencies if they are not there already.

To add Styled Components:
`yarn add styled-components@^5.0.0`

Please check that you are using versions that match the peerDependencies listed in the components/package.json.

### 2. Add fonts

Add [IBM Plex Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans:300,400,500,600) and [IBM Plex Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans) to your application, however you prefer to load assets. An example using Google Fonts is shown below.

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=IBM+Plex+Sans:300,400,500,600" rel="stylesheet" />
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=IBM+Plex+Mono" rel="stylesheet" />
```

If your application supports Simplified Chinese, you'll also need to load [Noto Sans SC](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans+SC).

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Sans+SC:wght@300;400;500&display=swap" rel="stylesheet" />
```

Note that loading fonts from Google API is just an example and not the most performant way to load fonts for your application. You'll most likely want to include the font's inside your existing asset pipeline.

### 2. Wrap your appliction in our theme provider

Wrap your application in the NDSProvider component to access Nulogy's theme values and add typographic defaults.

```js
import React from "react";
import { NDSProvider } from "@nulogy/components";

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <NDSProvider>// your application</NDSProvider>;
  }
}
```

### 3. Import desired components

```js
import { Button } from "@nulogy/components";

const SomeView = () => <Button>Click me</Button>;
```

## üåé Localization

A `locale` prop can be passed to `<NDSProvider />` to change the language of aria-labels and strings inside our components. See the [Localization Guide](https://nulogy.design/guides/localization) for the full list of supported languages and their codes.
